How do I approach designing software?

The new design demonstrates my skills on this project. This has gifted me the abilitiy to think creatively, have better visualization, utilize technology design,
drafting, and utilizing engineering and technology. Thinking creatively allows for me to develop, design, and create new applications and ideas. 
Visualization allows for me to imagine how something will look after it is moved arround or when its parts are rearranged.
Technology design involves generating or adapting equipment and technology to serve user needs. Drafting provides me with documentation,
detailed instructions, drawings, and/or specifications on how the application is to be assembled, modified, maintained, and used.
Utilzing engineering and technology means that I can apply principles and techniques to the design and production of various applications and projects.

How do I approach developing programs?

This was my first time working with OpenGL so a lot of new development strategies were put into place while working on my 3D scene. 
I learned to make use of different libraries and all of the features that they have to offer. Throughout the help and useful resources within the tutorials,
I used vertices and indices to create 3D objects. I then used these vertices and indices to create multiple objects. This allowed for me to successfully 
create multiple 3D objects for my scene.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

As a computer science student, I can utilize the knowledge and skills that I gained through out this course, 
within my future profession. Even if I don’t pursue a computational graphics and visualizations career,
I can utilize the skills I gained to any career path I take. The most important thing that I learned from this class was 
deconstructing a problem and planning to fix it. I can apply that to virtually any career path that I take. 
Also, if i work in a profession where I don’t necessarily work with 3D graphics directly, I can have a basic understanding incase it is needed in the future.

My computation graphics and visualization gifted me more skills and knowledge that I can apply to my 
future education and/or professional life. It gives me more leverage to get a better career as well. 
It helps me grasp more knowledge and be prepared for the next challenging course and or project in the field.
